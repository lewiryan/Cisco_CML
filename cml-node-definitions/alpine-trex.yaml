    Cisco TRex Traffic Generator Container

    (runs in *stateless* mode)

    512 MB DRAM

    ##### Users
    The user account is configurable (cisco/cisco by default).

    ##### Important
    TRex **MUST** have at least 2 interfaces. The first interface is used for
    management (consider to connect it using a bridged external connector and
    giving it a static IP so that a GUI can be connected to it), the 2nd and
    3rd interface is for data. The 3rd interface is optional.

    The GUI can be downloaded from
    [here](https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-stateless-gui),
    search for "Builds". Ensure the version matches the image.
