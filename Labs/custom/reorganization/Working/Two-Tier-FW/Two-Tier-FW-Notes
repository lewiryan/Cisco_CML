In this example we are using a Two-Tiered DMZ design, we have four physical ASA's

Using RFC: 5737
The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2),
and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in documentation.

In this example using RFC 5737 for "public" internet

Using RFC: 1918
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
     172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

In this example using RFC 1918 for "Local" Network

VM Maestro Note:
This desgin is in Infrastruce Only mode for AutoNetKit, however in order for
firewalls to be working in this mode for management on a shared flat the following
configuration needs to be applyied to all firewalls:

  nameif mgmt
  security-level 100
  
Otherwise you would not be able to connect to these devices on the shared flat.
When you first configure them.

Desgin Overview:

                                                            --DMZ LAN--
                                                            |
                  <-  FW-1 -> 			                    FW-3->
(Internet Switch)     HA (Pair) <-- Vestibule Network -->   HA (Pair) --INTERNAL LAN--
                  <-  FW-2 ->			                    FW-4->
                                                            |
                                                            --DMZ LAN--

This has a public switch connected to ASA's (FW-1 and FW-2)
outside interfaces which are "public" IP addersses.
