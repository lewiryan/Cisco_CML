    # Requirements:  
    CML 2.8+ **paid version**

    A lab that focuses mainly on configuring trunk links and VLANs and Controlling which VLANs are allowed on a trunk link.

    * Dynamic Trunks
    * Basic VTP operation
    * Modify the allowed list on trunk links.

  notes: |-
    
    #### In this Lab:

    We have six IOSvL2 switches, although not depicted in the topology these switches have two links connected to each other. 
    This lab is going to focus on configuring trunk links and VLANs. For example controlling which VLANs are allowed on particular
    trunk link. We will also look at dynamic trunks and basic VTP operation.
    
    #### Task 1:

    - Shutdown all ports on all six switches and configure the VTP domain to be: **ryansrealm.com** We also need to change the
      VTP mode to server for all switches.

    #### Task 2:

    Configure an 802.1Q (dot1q) trunk link between SW3 and SW5:
    - SW3 **G1/1** and SW5 **G0/3** should be a trunk link unconditionally. Bring the interfaces up.
    - "SW3 **G1/0** should be a trunk link but actively negotiate a trunk link on its port. SW5 **G0/2** should be only configured
       to negotiate a trunk once it receives negotiation packets from a neighboring port and actively try to convert links into trunk ports."
    
    #### Task 3:

    - Between SW4 (**G0/2**, **G0/3**) and SW5 (**G0/0**, **G0/1**) interfaces bring up a trunk link with SW5 being passive on negotiation of
      the trunk. While SW4 to auto trunk and actively negotiate but use the standard dot1q encapsulation, and bring up the interfaces.
    
    #### Task 5:

    - Between SW4 (**G0/0**, **G0/1**) and SW2 (**G1/1**, **G1/0**) configure the SW2 interfaces to be trunk links with the dot1q standard.
      While SW4 to auto trunk and passively negotiate.

    #### Task 6:

    Configure the following VLANs, 3–10, 100, 150, 200, 450, 230, 359, 353, 240, 250, and 340 on SW2 only. Ensure they are propagated to the following switches.
    - SW3
    - SW4
    - SW5

    #### Task 7:

    Add VLANs to the following interfaces:
    
    | Switch | Interface | VLAN           |
    |--------|-----------|----------------|
    | SW3    | G1/1      | 5-10           |
    | SW5    | G0/3      | 5-10           |
    | SW3    | G1/0      | 100, 150, 450  |
    | SW5    | G0/2      | 100, 150, 450  |
    | SW2    | G1/1      | All but 340    |
    | SW4    | G0/1      | All but 340    |
    | SW4    | G0/0      | 8-10, 250, 340 |
    | SW2    | G1/0      | 8-10, 250, 340 |
