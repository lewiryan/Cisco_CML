In this example we are using a Two-Tiered DMZ design, we have four physical ASA's

Using RFC: 5737
The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2),
and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in documentation.

In this example using RFC 5737 for "public" internet

Using RFC: 1918
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
     172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

In this example using RFC 1918 for "Local" Network

VM Maestro Note:
This desgin is in Infrastruce Only mode for AutoNetKit, however in order for
firewalls to be working in this mode for management on a shared flat the following
configuration needs to be applyied to all firewalls:

  nameif mgmt
  security-level 100
  
Otherwise you would not be able to connect to these devices on the shared flat.
When you first configure them.

Desgin Overview:

Pub-R1 ->  -> FW-1 -> 				FW-3->
HSRP (Pair)	  HA (Pair) --DMZ LAN--	HA (Pair) --INT LAN--
Pub-R2 -> -> FW-2 ->				FW-4->

This has two public routers connected to ASA's (FW-1 and FW-2)
outside interfaces which are "public" IP addersses.

Outside Network: 203.0.113.116/28
Gateway 203.0.113.117

FW-1 outside interface: 203.0.113.118 (Primary)
FW-1 HA - 10.0.1.1/30
FW-2 HA Secondary - 10.0.1.2/30
FW-2 outside interface: 203.0.113.117

Pub-R1 outside interface: 203.0.113.119 (Primary)
Pub-R2 outside interface: 203.0.113.120 (Secondary)
HSRP is active on this network for Pub-Routers

DMZ LAN Network: 10.1.0.0/24
FW-1 Inside interface:  10.1.0.1
FW-2 HA Secondary
FW-3 Outside interface: 10.1.0.253
FW-4 Outside interface: 10.1.0.254

LAN Network: 10.2.0.0/24
FW-3 Inside interface:  10.2.0.1
FW-4 HA Secondary
