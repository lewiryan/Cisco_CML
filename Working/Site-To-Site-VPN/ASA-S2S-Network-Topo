Network Topology:

ASA-1 <-> Internet-1 are using TEST-NET-1/25 Starting with 192.0.2.0 Network
Internet-1 <-> Internet-2 are using TEST-NET-2/30 Starting with 198.51.100.0 Network
Internet-2 <-> ASA-2 are using TEST-NET-3/25 Starting with 203.0.113.0 Network

Internet Routers are just using static routes to the outside interfaces of the ASA's for all TEST-NETs

ASA-1 DMZ Interface - 10.254.254.1/24
ASA-1 Outside Interface - 192.0.2.10/25
ASA-1 has public IP addressing that range begins at 192.0.2.0/25

Internet-1 Interface between ASA-1 - 192.0.2.1/25
