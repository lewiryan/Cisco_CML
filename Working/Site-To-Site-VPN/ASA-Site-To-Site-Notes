In this example we are using Site-To-Site VPN with ASAs, we have two physical ASA's

Using RFC: 5737
The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2),
and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in documentation.

In this example using RFC 5737 for "public" internet

Using RFC: 1918
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
     172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

In this example using RFC 1918 for "Local" Network

VM Maestro Note:
This desgin is in Infrastruce Only mode for AutoNetKit, however in order for
firewalls to be working in this mode for management on a shared flat the following
configuration needs to be applyied to all firewalls:

  nameif mgmt
  security-level 100
  
Otherwise you would not be able to connect to these devices on the shared flat.
When you first configure them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This topology is using Ubuntu servers and is in Infrastruce Only mode/Shared Flat becuase of this
these Ubuntu servers need to configured with an IP address and defualt gateway run the
apply the following to each Ubuntu Server as these are not configured automatically. Place
the following at the bottom of the configuration file on each server node.

- path: /etc/rc.local
  owner: root:root
  permissions: '0755'
  content: |-
    #!/bin/sh
    ifconfig eth1 up X.X.X.X netmask X.X.X.X
    route add default gw X.X.X.X
    exit 0

Network Topology:

ASA-1 <-> Internet-1 are using TEST-NET-1/25 Starting with 192.0.2.0 Network
Internet-1 <-> Internet-2 are using TEST-NET-2/30 Starting with 198.51.100.0 Network
Internet-2 <-> ASA-2 are using TEST-NET-3/25 Starting with 203.0.113.0 Network

Internet Routers are just using static routes to the outside interfaces of the ASA's for all TEST-NETs

ASA-1 Inside Interface - 10.0.0.1/24
ASA-1 DMZ Interface - 10.254.254.1/24
ASA-1 Outside Interface - 192.0.2.10/25
Internet-1 Interface between ASA-1 - 192.0.2.1/25
Internet-1 Interface between Internet-2 - 198.51.100.1/30
Internet-2 Interface between Internet-1 - 198.51.100.2/30
Internet-2 Interface between ASA-2 - 203.0.113.1/25
ASA-2 Outside Interface - 203.0.113.10/25
ASA-2 DMZ Interface - 172.31.255.1/24
ASA-2 Inside Interface - 172.17.1.1/24

ASA-1 has public IP addressing that range begins at 192.0.2.128/25
ASA-2 has public IP addressing that range begins at 203.0.113.128/25

DMZ-Server-1 has a public IP address of 192.0.2.130 and should be reachable.
