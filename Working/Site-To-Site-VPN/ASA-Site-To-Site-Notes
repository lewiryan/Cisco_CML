In this example we are using Site-To-Site VPN with ASAs, we have two physical ASA's

Using RFC: 5737
The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2),
and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in documentation.

In this example using RFC 5737 for "public" internet

Using RFC: 1918
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
     172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
     192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

In this example using RFC 1918 for "Local" Network

VM Maestro Note:
This desgin is in Infrastruce Only mode for AutoNetKit, however in order for
firewalls to be working in this mode for management on a shared flat the following
configuration needs to be applyied to all firewalls:

  nameif mgmt
  security-level 100
  
Otherwise you would not be able to connect to these devices on the shared flat.
When you first configure them.

Network Topology:

ASA-1 <-> Internet-1 are using TEST-NET-1/25 Starting with 192.0.2.0 Network
Internet-1 <-> Internet-2 are using TEST-NET-2/30 Starting with 198.51.100.0 Network
Internet-2 <-> ASA-2 are using TEST-NET-3/25 Starting with 203.0.113.0 Network

Internet Routers are just using static routes to the outside interfaces of the ASA's for all TEST-NETs


ASA-1 Inside Interface - 10.0.0.1/24
ASA-1 DMZ Interface - 10.254.254.1/24
ASA-1 Outside Interface - 192.0.2.10/24
Internet-1 Interface between ASA-1 - 192.0.2.1/25
Internet-1 Interface between Internet-2 - 198.51.100.1/30
Internet-2 Interface between Internet-1 - 198.51.100.2/30
Internet-2 Interface between ASA-2 - 203.0.113.1/25
ASA-2 Outside Interface - 203.0.113.10/25
ASA-2 DMZ Interface - 172.31.255.1/24
ASA-2 Inside Interface - 172.17.1.1/24

ASA-1 has public IP addressing that range begins at 192.0.2.128/25
ASA-2 has public IP addressing that range begins at 203.0.113.128/25
